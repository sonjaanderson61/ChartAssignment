Destination Tomorrow provides support for the LGBTQ community in the Bronx through programs like career readiness, education assistance and healthcare. This year, they received an MPV (monkeypox virus) Awareness Prevention Partnership grant (MAPP) from the Department of Health. It’s funding their monkeypox educational outreach program.

Director of Outreach Jahaira Gonzalez creates bags filled with condoms, literature about Destination Tomorrow’s programs and MPV palm cards to distribute when she goes out in the Bronx to spread awareness about monkeypox.

“Right now, MPV is targeting the LGBTQ,” said Gonzalez. “And especially living here in the Bronx—even though the LGBTQ is everywhere—specifically here in this borough, not too many people are open about themselves.”

Sage Rivera, Chief Development Programs Officer, agreed that the Bronx is generally less accepting of queer identities, pointing out that the borough has only one gay bar.

Destination Tomorrow offers vaccinations onsite at their Mott Haven location, and their messaging encourages anybody who is eligible to get the shots. </p1>
